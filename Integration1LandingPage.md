# Integration Phase 1 #



The first phase of integration is a "proof of concept" for the crossbow.  All pieces are intended to be on the Barebones-type boards.  IR transmit is still on a breadboard because the original team member responsible for IR dropped the course.  Other than IR transmit, the entire project is now on one cohesive board.  Individual blocks are still connected via header pins and jumpers, allowing for individual troubleshooting.
