# Integration 2 #



The Crossbow 2.0 is an arm-mounted weapon intended to integrate into the M.A.G.E. system.  User input is conducted using a capacitive touch interface, which registers variable length “swipes” to set firing strength (three to twenty-four MIRP packets).  The interface also accepts “taps” to fire and reload the weapon, based on context.  The crossbow has one IR emitter that sends out the IR damage packets (based on the set M.A.G.E. protocol). There is a cool-down period of 4 seconds between firing packets.  It also has four IR receivers in order to accept IR damage packets from other M.A.G.E. weapons.   If enough damage is received, the crossbow is “destroyed” and transmits an “I’m dead” packet over CANbus to the M.A.G.E. server.  Health status, cool-down period, and firing animations can be monitored via an OLED display.  Firing strength can be monitored via a row of LED bars.  Audio clips accompany actions, including firing, reloading, and receiving damage.


Integration 2 consisted of condensing the PCB design in order to fit the project inside the arm-mounted casing.
